Hi everyone!

If you enrolled into L03, I'll be accompanying you through out the next 7 weeks.

The first lab class will happen next Thursday at 14:30 at Room 02.09A. If you don't know where it's located, just go to the South Tower, go down to the -2 floor and look for a small room with an open door and lots of oscilloscopes inside.

*This is an oscilloscope:*

### I'll see you there!
