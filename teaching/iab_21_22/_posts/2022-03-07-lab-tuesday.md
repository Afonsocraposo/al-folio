Hi everyone!

So there a new lab shift was created to support the number of enrolled students.

This lab shift will take place on Tuesdays from 9:00 to 12:00. It actually concatenates two different lab sessions, one from 9:00 to 10:30 and another from 10:30 to 12:00.

So you'll carry out two lab guides:

- [L0. Lab Introduction](https://fenix.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/downloadFile/845043405573197/L0.%20Lab%20Introduction.pdf) - not evaluated
- [L1. Seeeduino Nano Essentials](https://fenix.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/downloadFile/845043405573201/L1.%20Seeeduino%20Nano%20Essentials%20-%20Jupyter%20Notebook.pdf) - **evaluated**

I'll see you tomorrow!
