So this week you'll be exploring digital to analog conversion, outputing an analog signal with your Arduino.

The guide for this lab is [here](https://fenix.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/downloadFile/563568428849708/L3.%20Digital-to-Analog%20Conversion%20%28DAC%29%20-%20Jupyter%20Notebook.pdf).

In this lab you'll have to do two things at the same time - control a square wave and measure the analog input - without blocking the main loop. How to do that?

First, to generate a square wave, you can use the `digitalWrite` function. Timing the turn `HIGH`/`LOW`, you can generate a square wave. Read more about this function [here](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/digital-io/digitalwrite/).

You can use the function `millis()` to keep track of time. Once a previously defined ammount of time has passed, you do something. Check the following example:

```cpp
unsigned long previous_time = 0;
unsigned int dt = 100;
unsigned long current_time = 0;

void setup {
    // setup your code
}

void loop {
    current_time = millis();
    if (current_time - previous_time > dt) {
        // do something here
        previous_time = current_time;
    }
}
```

As you can see in the example above, this will `do something` every `dt` milliseconds without blocking the `loop`.

To do two things at the same time, with different intervals, without blocking the `loop`, you can use something similar to the following code:

```cpp
unsigned long pt1 = 0;
unsigned long pt2 = 0;

unsigned int dt1 = 100;
unsigned int dt2 = 100;

unsigned long ct = 0;

void setup {
    // setup your code
}

void loop {
    ct = millis();
    
    if (ct - pt1 > dt1) {
        // do something here
        pt1 = ct;
    }

    if (ct - pt2 > dt2) {
        // do something else here
        pt2 = ct;
    }
}
```

Another thing that you have to do is generating a square wave with half the amplitude, Vcc/2. You can easily accomplish that using a voltage divider:

Where `Vin` is connected to the digital output pin and `Vout` to the analog input pin.
