I developed this application for two editions of the TEDxULisboa: 2019 and 2020. The first version of the application was implemented in Android Java and used Firebase as its backend. The second version, for the 2020 edition, was implemented using Flutter and Firebase.

Its features:

üé§ Find everything about your favorite speakers and get inspired by their remarkable stories!

üí¨ Want to network with other attendees? Or have a question for our speakers? Easy! Use the chat to exchange messages with speakers, ambassadors and participants. The official TEDxULisboa App has end2end encryption to ensure that only you and the person you are communicating with can read what is sent.

üìÖ Don't want to miss a talk or Live Q&A? Fear not! Access the program and select what you want to watch, and we'll let you know when it's about to start!

ü§ù Want to know more about the partners who made this event possible? Look them up in the Community tab and discover exclusive discounts, just for you!

The app is available in the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tedxulisboa.tedxulisboa20&hl=en_AU) and App Store.
