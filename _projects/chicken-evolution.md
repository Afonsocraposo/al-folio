I developed this project as a fun way to demonstrate the functioning of an evolutionary algorithm.

The code was developed in Unity using C# and integrates the three main events of an evolutionary algorithm: reproduction, mutation, and death.

The code is publicly available [here](https://github.com/afonsocraposo/Chicken-Evolution).
