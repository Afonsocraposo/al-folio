e-CoVig aims to implement a low-cost solution for monitoring a large number of subjects in COVID-19 quarantine.

The system couples a cloud-based eHealth platform for collection, management and visualization of physiological and clinical data, with a smartphone-based ubiquitous system for acquiring COVID-19 symptomatic measurements (pulse oximetry, temperature, heart rate and respiration).
