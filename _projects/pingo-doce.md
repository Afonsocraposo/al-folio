A simple Google Chrome extension that allows its users to sort the products by price per quantity at Pingo Doce online store. I created this extension since I often use this online store and I'd like to get the cheapest price per ammount of product that I'm buying.

[Try it](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/%E2%82%ACpingo-doce/jneaaojdlnbdfobbmjknglcegniegpbj?hl=pt-PT) or check its [source code](https://www.github.com/afonsocraposo/chrome-pingo-doce).

## Results

Notice that after applying the extension the products appear in an ascending order from lower price per kilo to higher price per kilo.

### Before

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/projects/pingo-doce/antes.jpg" title="before" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

### After

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/projects/pingo-doce/depois.jpg" title="after" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
