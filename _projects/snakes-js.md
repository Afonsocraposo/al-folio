In this game, two players (1v1) can compete to see which can grow the largest snake, while also being able to eat the other player if heâ€™s smaller.

I developed this game in one afternoon! I was on vacation with my girlfriend and she challenged me to develop a complete game while she took a nap after lunch. As soon as she fell asleep, I started creating this. When she woke up, we had a fresh game to play together!
