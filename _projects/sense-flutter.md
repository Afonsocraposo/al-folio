This is the official Android application for interacting with the ScientISST Sense Device.

This application allows connecting a ScientISST device via Bluetooth, defining of acquisition settings using the application, recording and plotting of signals using the device, and sharing your acquisitions in multiple platforms.

A ScientISST device is required for unlocking all the features of this application.

When recording an acquisition, the data is saved in a ".csv" file in the phone's memory. This file can then be shared with anyone using your preferred method.
