Hello world!

I am passionate about learning new skills and developing cool projects, which you can verify on my [GitHub](https://github.com/afonsocraposo)

At the moment, I am working on a PhD thesis regarding the mobile acquisition of biosignals and the use of machine learning algorithms to process these signals. I have a large experience in front-end development, more specifically, mobile development using Flutter and web development using Vue.js; but also back-end development, using Python, and Java.

I love tinkering with new technologies and finding the solution to problems. I am motivated and focused, thus I canâ€™t rest until my code runs!
