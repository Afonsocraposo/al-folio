Hello, world!

I'm a Biomedical Engineering from Lisbon. I'm currently doing my PhD thesis on "Mobile-Cloud Platform for eHealth in Cardiology" at Instituto Superior Técnico (IST), integrated in Instituto de Telecomunicações (IT), and Institute for Systems and Robotics (ISR), Lisbon, Portugal.

I enjoy learning about new things and understanding how everything works. I also like sharing what I learn and create with others, so expect to find more about everything here.

Btw, I use Arch!
