Hello world!

I am a Full Stack Engineer at Prezi, part of the Growth Platform Team.

I have a bachelor's and a master's degree in Biomedical Engineering from Instituto Superior Técnico, Portugal.

I am passionate about learning new skills and developing cool projects, which you can verify on my [GitHub](https://github.com/afonsocraposo)

I have a large experience in front-end development, more specifically, mobile development using Flutter and web development using Javascript, Typescript, and Vue.js; but also back-end development, using Python, and Java.

I love tinkering with new technologies and finding the solution to problems. I am motivated and focused, thus I can’t rest until my code runs!
